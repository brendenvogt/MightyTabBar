<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Description

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

MightyTabBar is a customizable tab bar that doubles as a menu drawer. Instead of being limited to 5 tab bar items, MightyTabBar allows your app to have up to 30 tab bar items, all positioned within the thumb zone and easily accessible via swipe up.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue with the tag.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
